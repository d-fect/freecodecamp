    <h1>Welcome to my freeCodeCamp projects site</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><em>Updated: feb 16th, 2019</em></p>
    <p>This site is pretty empty right now, but will fill up with projects when I get to them in the curriculum.</p>
    <p>I have now started on the Basic CSS part of this course, so this page is now updated with some rather simple CSS.
    </p>
    <p>I want this page to reflect where I am in the course, so when I learn more CSS, javascript etc., this page should
      hopefully start to incorporate more of that and get nicer to look at and with more functionality.</p>
    <p>Hope you'll tag along on the journey.</p>
