            <h1>The ever important background story</h1>
            <p>Spring 2019 I started my journey through the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
                Well, technically not 100% true, since I had a failed start a few years earlier, but this is my main
                push.
                This page will be a portfolio showcasing my poor attempts at building the projects needed to complete
                this very ambitious course.</p>
            <p>This page will be divided into sections mirroring the curriculum.
                This means you will get six main sections, and maybe some others if I come up with cool projects on the
                side.
                Don't hold your breath for those, as I have no real ideas for anything right now.
                I will rebuild my person website sometime and also create a page for a friend of mine, but when that
                happens depends on many variables, some of which I have little control.</p>
            <p>So far there are only Responsive Web Design projects on this page, but the rest of the curriculum will be
                added as I get to the projects.</p>
            <p>If you stumble upon my freeCodeCamp profile page, you might find some links to projects I did when I
                prematurely started this journey a few years back.
                Please don't look at them. They are ugly, probably not working and will only make you point and laugh at
                me... :D
            </p>
            <p>But enough about me and without further ado, let's get the portfolio started!</p>
