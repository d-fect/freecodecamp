    <h1>Welcome to my freeCodeCamp projects site</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This site is pretty empty right now, but will fill up with projects when I get to them in the curriculum.</p>
    <p>As you can see this site is also pretty boring right now. That's because I've just restarted freeCodeCamp and so
      this is just pure HTML.</p>
    <p>I want this page to reflect where I am in the course, so when I learn more CSS, javascript etc., this page should
      hopefully start to incorporate more of that and get nicer to look at and with more functionality.<p>
        <p>Hope you'll tag along on the journey.</p>
